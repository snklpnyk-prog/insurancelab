Build a premium, modern, fully responsive, SEO-optimized insurance & risk advisory website that matches exactly the same structure, layout flow, UI sections, spacing, and hierarchy as the screenshot I provided.

⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION

❌ Do NOT skip, remove, merge, or redesign any section from the screenshot
